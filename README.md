# IndentationAnalysis

This is a package of functions for making strain rate jump load functions for the Bruker Hysitron TI980. 

Most of this is well tested. Some portions, particularly those related to spherical indentation ldf generation, are very much still being tested.

If you encounter any errors or issues, please contact me! My goal is to release a bug-free set of code. It's unlikely for that to be the case.
