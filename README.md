# Indentation Analysis
This is a package of functions for making strain rate jump load functions for the Bruker Hysitron TI980. For compatibility purposes: The load function generator is written in Python 3.7.6; the analysis functions are written in Matlab 2020.

An article regarding these functions has been submitted to Experimental Mechanics. Until that is published, the best (peer-reviewed) representation of the data quality is from my earlier work on microcrystalline cellulose from early 2021, which can be found at https://doi.org/10.1557/s43578-021-00138-0. I'll post the link to the Experimental Mechanics article after peer review has been completed.

Most of this is well tested. Some portions, particularly those related to spherical indentation ldf generation, are still being tested. If you encounter any errors or issues, please contact me! My goal is to release a bug-free set of code. It's unlikely for that to be the case.

For information on input parameters and how to use the software, please see the "Using the Software" pdf. 

In theory, much of this code could be adapted for non-Bruker/Hysitron systems. If you are interested in doing so, let me know!
